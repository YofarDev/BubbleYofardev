# Bubble Yofardev

This is a free, user-friendly tool designed to quickly add comic-style bubble text to images. The tool is developed using Flutter and is [available online](https://bubble-yofardev.web.app/) for free, with a desktop version coming soon.
(I did this tool quickly and only for me at first and didn't plan to share it, neither to release the code, so don't judge me on its quality üòÅ)
